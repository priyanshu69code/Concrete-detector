# Wall Crack Prediction using YOLO

This project focuses on predicting wall cracks in videos using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The model is trained to detect and highlight wall cracks in the provided video.

## Getting Started

To run the prediction, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ubRZDcQbxmYXroPqvQOwULztfHNRbWLT?authuser=2#scrollTo=v3DhIODpRwtr).

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Mount Google Drive by executing the cell that contains:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

4. Create a folder in your Google Drive where the model and output will be stored:
   ```python
   !mkdir /content/drive/MyDrive/Wallcrackprediction
   ```

5. Upload the YOLO model (`best.pt`) into the created folder.

6. Upload the video (`your_video1.mp4`) that you want to analyze.

7. Execute the YOLO detection command:
   ```python
   !yolo task=detect mode=predict model=/content/drive/MyDrive/Wallcrackprediction/best.pt conf=0.77 source=/content/drive/MyDrive/Wallcrackprediction/your_video1.mp4
   ```

8. After detection, create an `output` folder and copy the output files to it:
   ```python
   !mkdir /content/runs/segment
   !cp -r /content/runs/segment /content/drive/MyDrive/Wallcrackprediction/output
   ```

9. View the results in the `output` folder.

## Note
- Make sure to replace `/content/drive/MyDrive/Wallcrackprediction/` and `/content/drive/MyDrive/Wallcrackprediction/your_video1.mp4` with the actual paths to your model and video file.

- Adjust the confidence threshold (`conf=0.77`) as needed for your use case.
```
